		<h2 style="color:green;"><i>The best road/all-road riding in and around Boulder, CO</i></h2>

		<h3><b>The Point of This Site</b></h3>
		<p style="text-align=left">
		This site was born out of inspiration from the original Bestrides site, Bestrides.org, which covers the best road bike riding in the states of California and Oregon. To echo the sentiments of its owner, Jay, perusing Strava heatmaps or googling "best rides in ___" is often a tedious (and fruitless) endeavor when you're looking for quality riding in a given area. If you like to ride your bike, ideally when you're traveling somewhere you'd like a reliable source that simply tells you, "you're here, now. So look no further and do these rides."</br></br>

		A former resident of California, I came across Bestrides.org when searching for the best routes in different parts of California that I could hit before I moved away. Once I found it, I never used anything else. From rides in my local Bay Area to Napa, down the central coast to Santa Barbara, out to the Sierras, up the northern coast and through southern and central Oregon -- I found here the best advice, including all the pickiness for all the right reasons you'd ever want to inform decisions when you're traveling and have a limited amount of time, and therefore need an efficient way of doing things. I loved every minute of the riding, and I only got around to a small sliver of what's out there.</br></br>

		To those ends, having moved from San Francisco to Boulder, this site exists to offer the best "road" rides in Northern Colorado with special emphasis in the front range, and even more so out of Boulder, with a few exceptions. Eventually, I'd like to cover the whole state. But it's a big state and I'm one person, so in due time. I use the term "road" loosely, because in Boulder and its surrouding areas, while there is a plethora of routes that strictly involve tarmac, there is also a sprawling network of roads with firm, hard-packed dirt (people call them "gravel" roads here, but in practice they are essentially smooth dirt versions of tarmac) intertwined with paved sections. There are also a few proper gravel climbs and descents that are off-limits to cars. In a nutshell, the best of Boulder "road" riding includes proper tarmac, all-road (anywhere from sketchy pavement to hardpack dirt), and gravel. I will cover all of these in the Boulder area, as well as a few other routes around the state to start.</br></br>

		Boulder is a town with incredible bike infrastructure, both on road and in the form of bike and recreational paths, and is a hub for an excellent selection of climbs of varying profiles. Within Boulder proper sit the bases of four notable roads that are particularly well renowned: Flagstaff, Boulder Canyon (which splits multiple times into several others), Sunshine Canyon, and Lefthand Canyon (which forks into James Canyon). North of Boulder lies an extensive network of paved and dirt roads stretching to Lyons and Hygiene. Turn south, and you'll find trails running throughout Marshall Mesa, as well as -- if you want -- a ruler-straight death slog from Boulder to Denver, albeit on a protected, well-paved rec path. Look east to find an array of flats for recovery or training, depending on your cup of tea, and a surprisingly pleasant (and significant) network of flat dirt trails to, from, and surrounding the communities of Gunbarrel and Niwot.

		<h3><b>Riding Quality</b></h3>
		<p>
		In my opinion, the best riding in the United States -- by far -- sits in California and Oregon. So far, I've only done a portion of what's out there, but among what I consider my favorites (Gibraltar, Prefumo Canyon, Tunitas Creek, Stage Road, Mt Hamilton, Mt Diablo, anything in Marin, anything out of Mendocino, Ebbetts Pass, Pacific Grade, Dead Indian, McKenzie Pass), nothing else comes close. Having said that, next up after this upper echelon is easily Colorado. The reasons for this are many which, in part as an homage to the original Bestrides and in part due to my having a foot in both camps, I will attempt to outline below:
		</p>

		<b>Variety / Geography</b>
		<p>
		If you randomly picked cyclists out of a hat experienced in west coast riding, and you asked them for their favorite rides in California and Oregon, in response you could very easily (likely) get rides in the following environments: coast Redwoods, rolling hills, granite monoliths, pristine farmland, alpine juggernauts, beach cruises, thick forests, craggy canyons, bustling creeks, canopied back roads, volcanoes, alpine lakes, or giant Sequoias -- and in many cases, a number of those in one route. All of that exists in one state, and 90% of it can be ridden year-round (75% of the time with excellent weather). </br></br>
		Colorado, on the other hand, while stunningly beautiful, has virtually one environment: the Rockies. Unless you ride in the eastern third of the state (why would you), there is beautiful, dramatic scenery everywhere you look but, at the risk of complaining about something so revered, it can at times grow one-dimensional. No two mountains are the same -- and it is true that many of the red rock formations here are unique to Colorado -- but variation is welcome from time to time. Furthermore, when everything is north of 5,000 feet, you can bank on six to seven months of quality weather (though that quality is pristine) with a guarantee of at least three months per year of unrideable conditions throughout much of the state (Boulder notwithstanding).
		</p>
		<b>Road Networks</b>
		<p>
		The best roads in California and Oregon simply feel like they were graded and cut for cyclists when you ride them. They are near perfect. Many of the famous rides in Colorado -- several of the Copper Triangle passes, Loveland pass, Trail Ridge Road, Table Mesa, e.g. -- are straighter and often far more monotonous.</br></br>

		Some states seem to have a knack for tucking roads into every corner of the state. In the mountains, in the flats, on the coast, strewn between communities in the foothills, and quite literally everywhere in between. Colorado is not quite that way. The reason for this, in my opinion, is that the majority of Colorado's "best" riding sits within the high Rockies, at or above 5-6k ft, where the roads (1) were originally graded for ferrying folks and supplies to/from popular spots up easier-to-traverse paved roads on bigger mountains and are therefore straighter, more gradual, and less interesting on 2 wheels, and (2) get heavy snowfall, which also means plowing with heavy industrial/commercial equipment annually as a result. In short, if you ask "why is this road even here?", chances are you have your answer in Colorado.</br></br>

		On the flipside, California for example certainly has its Sierras equivalents -- it's a big mountain range with large arteries like any other -- but even then, the road network seems more extensive. There are an infinite number of smaller back roads with minimal traffic. Beyond that, I'd say the best riding exists there because there is a seemingly endless supply of smaller ranges, foothills, and coastal mountains that offer great riding, that are plenty big enough to feature big climbs and grand descents, and that don't need to be at 7k ft. California is on the coast, afterall, and 70% of its top-notch stuff starts at (or somewhere near) sea level. It therefore enjoys a moderate coastal climate, yielding near perfect conditions basically year round, and there seems to be an infinite amount of roads with a combination of minimal traffic, gorgeous terrain, fun contours, interesting profiles, and excellent surfaces.

		<b>Dirt</b>
		<p>
		For no apparent reason, some places have a plethora of double track fire roads, smooth single track, multi use recreation trails, etc. strewn within local hills/mountains/open spaces that are suitable for drop bar riding but that are not accessible to cars. Boulder, with a few exceptions, is not that way, but there is still excellent dirt riding to be found.</br></br>

		The flat (ish) dirt roads north of Boulder proper are mixed in with tarmac without rhyme or reason. For a couple reasons, this is not ideal: the area is mostly made up of long, straight rollers that can be monotonous (and rather unpleasant on a windy day), and these roads are available to cars, which makes the surfaces in many areas riddled with brake tracks and pot holes. Having said that, there are several fun fast sections, a handful of double track and single track sections that are extremely fun, and there are beautiful views everywhere you look. Another plus is that the profile of this road network allows you to make your rides through here as easy or as hard as you'd like.</br></br>

		In the mountains, Chapman Drive is one exception to the no-cars rule around Boulder. It's a double track fire road offering a lovely climb and a fast, twisty descent. The connector between the west end of town and the base of the climb is Boulder Creek path, another no-car path/trail -- awesome when paired with one another. There also sits Joder Ranch which connects CO-36 and Olde Stage Road, Rowena trail off of Lefthand Canyon, Marshall Mesa down south near Superior, and the Niwot trail network northeast of town. All things considered, quite a solid collection of car-free dirt stuff -- but ultimately limited in comparison to shared roads.
